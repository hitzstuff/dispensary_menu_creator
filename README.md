# About:
Flourish (https://www.flourishsoftware.com/) is a popular Retail Point of Sale for Cannabis dispensaries, and it allows a user to export a store's inventory into an Excel file.  Using this exported file...

This utility is used to configure a printable menu for a cannabis dispensary, and uses a pre-formatted template to create a nice-looking menu for customers to look at.  Not only is position on the menu--limited--possible, but discounts of the day can also quickly be applied, and will be reflected on the menu as being discounted (with the new price).

Future releases and source code will be made available on this GitHub project page.
